# Rocket Projectile Trajectory Calculator

This repository contains code for calculating the trajectory of a rocket projectile given initial conditions such as velocity, launch angle, and initial height. The code is implemented in Python and provides solutions to various problems related to projectile motion.

## Features

- **Parametric Equations Calculation**: Given the initial velocity, launch angle, and initial height, the code calculates the parametric equations for the trajectory of the rocket projectile.
- **Horizontal Distance and Time Calculations**: Determines the horizontal distance traveled by the projectile and the time it takes to hit the ground.
- **Graph Plotting**: Provides a visualization of the rocket projectile's trajectory using matplotlib.

## Usage

To use the code, simply clone the repository and run the Python script. You can modify the initial conditions in the script according to your requirements.

git clone https://github.com/your_username/rocket-projectile-trajectory-calculator.git
cd rocket-projectile-trajectory-calculator
python trajectory_calculator.py


## Dependencies

The code requires the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- matplotlib

You can install the dependencies using pip:

pip install matplotlib


## Examples

Here are some examples of the problems solved by the code:

1. Calculating the trajectory of a rocket launched at a certain angle and velocity.
2. Determining the maximum height reached by a projectile.
3. Finding the horizontal distance traveled by a projectile when it hits the ground.
